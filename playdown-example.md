# ext indistinguishable dark location - night

> Faint, indistinguishable glowing objects float in the air. Then, a slow, high-pitched ringing. Like a whistle, but not as frantic

# ext inside settlement walls - night

> *Abram* startles awake. His eyes scan his surroundings, as if he doesn't know where he is.

> RING.

> It's eerie, ominous, and distant.

> *Abram* stumbles through the sand and brush.

> RING.

> RING.

> It's getting louder. He's close.

> *Abram* moves almost against his will, pulled toward the sound as it gets louder and louder, until finally, he finds it: an ALIEN ARTIFACT.

> The Artifact is about the length of a regular sheet of paper, but much thinner. It is trapezoidal, except for a few seemingly random and inconsistent grooves on each side.

> A faint, golden glow emanates from the grooves.

> RING.

> *Abram* pauses when he sees it. He studies it for a moment, but the pull toward it is strong.

> RING.

> This last ring is too much for Abram to bear. He thrusts forward and grabs onto the Artifact.

# int doctor's office - day

> *abram* sits forward on a chair, elbows resting on his knees, fingers interlaced, and eyes giving way to what he's heard.

> Beside him, his *wife* sits and talks with a *doctor*, off-screen.

> We hear what they're saying, but it's distant, muffled.

* wife
...Stage 4? Is that-

* doctor
That's the highest.

* wife
The highest?

> Pause.

* doctor
It's the most progressed.

* wife
Oh. Okay...

* doctor
We'll need to start an aggressive treatment right away...

> All the while, Abram sits, motionless.
