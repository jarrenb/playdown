# ext indistinguishable dark location - night

> Faint, indistinguishable glowing objects float in the air. Then, a slow, high-pitched ringing. Like a whistle, but not as frantic

# ext inside settlement walls - night

> *Abram* startles awake. His eyes scan his surroundings, as if he doesn't know where he is.

> RING.

> It's eerie, ominous, and distant.

> Abram stumbles through the sand and brush.

> RING.

> RING.

> It's getting louder. He's close.

> Abram moves almost against his will, pulled toward the sound as it gets louder and louder, until finally, he finds it: an **alien artifact**.

> The Artifact is about the length of a regular sheet of paper, but much thinner. It is trapezoidal, except for a few seemingly random and inconsistent grooves on each side.

> A faint, golden glow emanates from the grooves.

> RING.

> Abram pauses when he sees it. He studies it for a moment, but the pull toward it is strong.

> RING.

> This last ring is too much for Abram to bear. He thrusts forward and grabs onto the Artifact.

# int doctor's office - day

> Abram sits forward on a chair, elbows resting on his knees, fingers interlaced, and eyes giving way to what he's heard.

> Beside him, his *wife* sits and talks with a *doctor*, off-screen.

> We hear what they're saying, but it's distant, muffled.

* wife
...Stage 4? Is that-

* doctor
That's the highest.

* wife
The highest?

> Pause.

* doctor
It's the most progressed.

* wife
Oh. Okay...

* doctor
We'll need to start an aggressive treatment right away...

> All the while, Abram sits, motionless.

# ext cemetery - dusk

> Match frame on Abram, now sitting beside a casket, ready to be laid to rest. He's by himself. The far right seat in a row of empty chairs.

* wife (v.o.)
Abram?

> Her voice echoes. Long since gone.

> Abram is at the tail-end of his weeping. He inhales deeply and sits up straight. He holds his breath for a moment before a long exhale.

* apparition (o.s.)
It doesn't have to be this way.

> That voice is too familiar.

> Abram looks down the row of chairs, spotting what appears to be his wife sitting in the last one. She looks young, perfect, beautiful. She wears a long, simple off-white dress with a blue trim down either side.

> Abram is paralyzed by the sight of her.

> The Apparition stands, approaches him, and crouches in front of him. She draws in close, locking eyes with him.

* apparition
What if you could save me?

# int abram and wife's room - night

> The bedroom is still and quiet. The TV plays to an absent audience.

> A light bleeds out from the open bathroom door across the short carpet.

> **pov**: approaching the door. The sound of heavy breathing from someone who is desperately ill. Coming up on the door and looking inside to find:

# int bathroom - continuous

> Abram holds his wife's hair back as she grips to the toilet, extremely sick.

> Her Apparition stands in the doorway. We never hear the sound of the vomiting.

> Abram watches his sweet, sick wife, completely helpless.

* apparition
You watched me die for months.

> Abram looks up at the Apparition, tortured. He looks back to his sick wife.

> She flushes the toilet and he pulls his hand out of her hair, taking a clump of it with him. He stares at it in disbelief.

* apparition
You were so helpless.

* abram
Why are you doing this to me?

# int doctor's office - day

> Back in the same place and position as before. Abram sits at the office, his wife next to him.

> The conversation is muffled as we stay on Abram, but we still hear the content.

* doctor
...I'm not sure... I suppose we can just call it a false alarm.

* wife
What does that mean?

* doctor
It means you are healthy. No tumor.

> Abram shakes off his hyper-focus and tunes into the conversation.

* wife
No tumor.

* doctor
That's correct.

> She grabs Abram's arm. Abram looks at both of them, trapped in an endless series of double-takes. Could this be real?

* wife
Did you hear that? No tumor. No cancer!

> Abram is conflicted, as if the diagnosis is too easy. He locks his gaze, but not on anything before him.

# ext indistinguishable dark location - night

> A **fire** glows. Abram and the Apparition sit across from each other, the fire in between. The Artifact is somehow the source of the fire. Flames dance over the top of it.

> Abram maintains his locked gaze on his past. He is completely checked out from the present. He accepts this new world.

> He adopts a faint smile.

* abram
You remember our favorite place?

# ext cabin - day

> A secluded cabin sits in an open patch of an otherwise thick forest. A dense fog weaves through the trees.

> On the porch, a wind chime calmly sings with each passing breeze. The sound seems to be in harmony with the rich sound of the world around the home: birds, water, the rustle of bushes and leaves.

> Two wooden rocking chairs sit on the corner of a wrap-around porch. At one point, the were white chairs, but the paint has worn down, leaving a dull gray.

> Abram's wife sits on one chair. The door squeaks open and Abram brings two steaming cups of tea with him, gently handing one to his wife before sitting.

> They're older now. In their sixties.

> For a long while, they sit and enjoy the incredible sounds around them. There are no sirens, no construction, no anything. Just the chimes and the world--as it was meant to be heard.

> The ring of the chimes begins to grow louder, however, interrupting their paradise. Well, Abram's anyway. Abram locks his eyes on the chimes, but notices the sound seems almost out of sync with the movement.

> Not just that, but the sound changes as it grows louder.

> Abram's wife is unfazed. She speaks normally, as if she can't hear the near-deafening chimes.

* wife
perfect day, huh?

> She sips her tea. Abram can't make sense of her normalcy. The chimes sound again. This time, they're muffled... diluted somehow. That sound, it's familiar.

> RING.

> There it is. It's the same ring from the Artifact. It's calling to him. His moment is broken. He snaps out of it, realizing what is actually happening.

> Abram stares at the Apparition, his wife.

* abram
Don't.

# ext indistinguishable dark location - night

> Back to the fire. Abram and the Apparition are in the same spots, facing each other.

* apparition
What?

* abram
Don't- Don't do that. And don't act like you're her. You're not her.

> The flames dance over the Artifact again. This time, the tops of the flame show flashes of their paradise in the woods. It's as if, somehow, the flames are their means of travel to these different memories.

> The Apparition holds for a moment, watching Abram. She smiles, but just a little.

* apparition
No. I'm not.

* abram
The who are you? And what are you doing to me?

# ext cabin - day

> The vintage cabin sits just as cozy amidst the fog as it did before. Everything is the same.

> Except for the wind chimes. They're gone.

> On the porch, **two rocking chairs** sit, empty, until Abram emerges from the door with a cup of tea and sits.

> The sounds from before aren't quite the same anymore. There's a hollow whip through the air as Abram holds his cup, ready to take a sip.

> He pauses and looks out into the woods. he turns and looks the other direction. It's dark. Lonely.

> He looks at the second rocking chair. Isolated. Empty. Still.

# ext indistinguishable dark location - night

> Abram and the Apparition continue. Abram has resumed his trance, staring through the darkness.

* apparition
It doesn't have to be this way. Do you remember how alone you are?

> Abram doesn't break his trance. His eyes, his head, nothing moves. He's somber.

* abram
It's colder than I remember.

* apparition
We can free you from those pains, Abram. We can bring you peace.

> A flood of apparent memories flash through the flames before Abram.

* apparition (cont'd)
We are a race who has dedicated our lives to follow the teachings of the Originators, as you know them. For us, the foundation of all virtues is peace. Who we are in the present is the sum of what we have been in the past. With peace in our past, there will be peace in our present.

* abram
You can change the past?

* apparition
No. We change your memory of it.

> Abram watches the flames, reacting with laughter. Joy.

> Then somber.

* abram
I don't want to be alone anymore.

* apparition
So you're ready?

> Abram doesn't respond.

* apparition (cont'd)
Abram?

# ext. cabin - day

> Abram sits on the rocker. He still hasn't taken a sip of his tea.

> His face is the same as it is in front of the fire. Locked. Tranced. Somber.

> Then, a glimmer. His lips turn to a faint smile. his eyebrows raise just enough.

* abram
You've missed something.

# ext indistinguishable dark location - night

> The Apparition studies Abram. He maintains his trance, but now holds his smile.

* abram
It's so... wonderfully simple. And you missed it.

> The Apparition is at a loss.

# ext cabin - day

> Abram breaks his trance and looks toward the road coming into the cabin. THREE SUVs pull in and several *parents* and *children* jump out.

* children
Grandpa! Grandpa!

> A few of the younger kids run to Abram as he stands up. They throw their arms around him.

> Abram laughs with pure joy.

> Two of the parents come in just as the kids move on. They hug Abram.

* daughter
Hey dad. You got here quick.

> Abram laughs.

* abram
Had to have a few minutes of quiet before all these kids showed up. Who invited them anyway?

> Abram flashes a cheeky smile. The parents laugh.

* daughter
Tell me about it. My few minutes of quiet only happens when I give them treats and hide in the shower.

> They laugh again.

> The crowd of family makes their way into the house, greeting Abram as they arrive.

> As the last of them goes inside, shouts from the kids ring out as they claim their favorite spots to sleep. It's roucous at best.

> Abram can't contain his smile. He grabs his cup of tea again.

* abram
You still can't see it, can you?

# ext indistinguishable dark location - night

> Abram has broken his trance and looks at the Apparition.

* abram
You'll never be able to replace reality by hiding behind a false one. You think you are the first to introduce lies and distractions to humankind? No, we discovered that ages ago. We got very good at removing ourselves from reality.

* apparition
And did it bring you peace?

> Abram scoffs.

* abram
It brought us emptiness. Isolation. It took us away from real, human connection. See, we can't choose to eliminate our pain without also losing our sense of compassion. Of sympathy. The one can't exist without the other.

* apparition
You want this pain?

* abram
No. In the moment, I definitely don't want it. But in hindsight, I don't think I could ever bring myself to change those memories, however painful they are.

> He looks at her.

* abram (cont'd)
Even if given the opportunity.

> The Apparition considers this thought.

* abram (cont'd)
I want to be happy so much that I'm willing to endure all that pain to get it. Those false realities, those distractions, they don't fill a void. They just temporarily numb the pain. That's no solution.

> The Apparition thinks for a moment, careful to speak.

* apparition
Don't you ever wonder what type of man you'd be if you'd never lost her?

> Abram laughs again.

* abram
All the time. And it terrifies me.

> The Apparition stares at him.

> Abram's eyes lock onto one last memory.

# ext cemetery - dusk

> Abram sits in his same chair as before, empty chairs around him.

> the wind whips through the silent graveside, just as hollow as the memory at the cabin.

> It's cold, somber, hopeless. Abram weeps.

> Then:

* son (o.s.)
You ready?

> Abram looks up. His *family* stands before the casket. A few of them hold up small booklets for everyone to see.

> Abram stands and joins them.

> In unison, they begin:

* family
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now am found. Was blind, but now I see.

> As the family sings, we see:

## montage:

> Lowering the casket into the ground

> One-by-one, hands holding roses drop each rose onto the casket

* family
When we've been there ten thousand years, bright shining as the sun, We've no less days to sing God's praise, then when we first begun.

> Family members embracing

> Family memebers walking away, Abram last

> Grandson approaches, grabs him by the hand, and leads him forward.

## end montage.
